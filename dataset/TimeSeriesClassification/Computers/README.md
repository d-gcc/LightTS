The intention was to collect behavioural data about how consumers use electricity within the home to help reduce the UK's carbon footprint. The data contain readings from 251 households, sampled in two-minute intervals over a month. Each series is 720 data points in length (24 hours of readings taken every 2 minutes). Classes are Desktop and Laptop devices.

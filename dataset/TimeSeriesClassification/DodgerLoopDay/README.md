# DodgersLoop data sets

The traffic data are collected with the loop sensor installed on ramp for the 101 North freeway in Los Angeles. This location is close to Dodgers Stadium; therefore the traffic is affected by volumne of visitors to the stadium. 

We make three data sets out of these data.

# DiatomSizeReduction

Data are outlines of four types of diatoms: Gomphonema augur, Fragilariforma bicapitata, Stauroneis smithii and Eunotia tenella. The classes are size polymorphic because each successive generation of a clonaly reproducing diatom is slightly smaller than its ancestors.

Train size: 16

Test size: 306

Missing value: No

Number of classses: 4

Time series length: 345

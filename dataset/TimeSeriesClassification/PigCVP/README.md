# InternalBleeding data sets

The original data are from 52 pigs having three vital signs monitored before and after an induced injury. 

We make three data sets out of these data.

Class is the individual pig. In the training set, a class is represented by two examples: the first 2000 data points of the *before* time series and the first 2000 data points of the *after* time series. 

In the test set, a class is represented by four examples, the second and third 2000 data points of the *before* time series and the second and third 2000 data points of the *after* time series.

Train size: 104

Test size: 208

Missing value: No

Number of classses: 52

Time series length: 2000

## PigArtPressure
Arterial blood pressure measurements

Train size: 104

Test size: 208

Missing value: No

## PigCVP
Central venous pressure measurements

Train size: 104

Test size: 208

There is nothing to infer from the order of examples in the train and test set.

# Trace

This data set is a subset of the Transient Classification Benchmark (Trace project), an initiative at the turn of the twentieth century to collate data from the application domain of the process industry (e.g. nuclear, chemical, etc.). It is a synthetic data set designed to simulate instrumentation failures in a nuclear power plant, created by Davide Roverso (see [1]). The full data set consists of 16 classes, with 50 instances in each class. Each instance has four features. 

The *Trace* subset is a four-class time series classification problem. It only uses the second feature of class 2 and 6, and the third feature of class 3 and 7. All instances are linearly interpolated to have the same length of 275 data points, and are z-normalized. The data were used in [2].

# OSULeaf

The *OSULeaf* data set consists of one dimensional outlines of leaves. The series were obtained by color image segmentation and boundary extraction (in the anti-clockwise direction) from digitized leaf images of six classes: Acer Circinatum, Acer Glabrum, Acer Macrophyllum, Acer Negundo, Quercus Garryana and Quercus Kelloggii. Data were made as part of the MSc thesis of Ashit Grandhi [1].

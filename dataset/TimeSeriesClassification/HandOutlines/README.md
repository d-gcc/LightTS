# HandOutlines

This classification problem was created as part of Luke Davis's PhD (see [1]). Data are outlines of hand derived from images used by Cao et al. (see [2]). They are designed to test the efficacy of hand and bone outline detection and whether these outlines could be helpful in bone age prediction. A range of algorithms were applied to automatically extract the hand outlines from over 1300 images, and three human evaluators labelled the output of the image outlinings as correct or incorrect. The data is described in detail in [3].

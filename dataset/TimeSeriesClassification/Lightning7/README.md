The Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events satellite (FORTE) detects transient electromagnetic events associated with lightning using a suite of optical and radio-frequency (RF) instruments. Sampling rate was 50MHz over a period of 800 microseconds. A Fourier transform is performed on the input data to produce a spectrogram. The spectrograms are then collapsed in frequency to produce a power density time series, with 3181 samples in each time series. These are then smoothed to produce series of length 637. 

There are 7 classes as described in [1]: (label: name: description)
- CG: Positive: Initial Return Stroke A positive charge is lowered from a cloud to the ground. The characteristic feature of this type of event in the power density time series is a sharp turn-on of radiation, followed by a few hundreds of microseconds of noise. 
- IR: Negative Initial Return Stroke A negative charge is lowered from a cloud to ground. The power waveform slowly ramps up to a level known as an attachment point, where a large surge current causes the VHF power to 'spike'. This attachment is followed by an exponentially shaped decline in the waveform. 
- SR: Subsequent Negative Return Stroke A negative charge is lowered from a cloud to ground. As the name implies, subsequent return strokes come after initial return strokes. Note that subsequent positive return strokes don't exist. 
- I: Impulsive Event Typically an intra-cloud event characterized by a sudden peak in the waveform. 
- I2: Impulsive Event Pair Another intra-cloud event characterized by sudden peaks in the waveform that come in closely separated pairs. These are also called TIPPs (Trans-Ionospheric Pulse Pairs). 
- KM: Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke An intra-cloud event which increases in power more gradually than an impulsive event. 
- O: Off-record 800 microseconds was not enough to fully capture the lightning event.

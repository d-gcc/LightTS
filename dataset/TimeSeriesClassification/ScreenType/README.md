The intention was to collect behavioural data about how consumers use electricity within the home to help reduce the UK's carbon footprint. The data contain readings from 251 households sampled in two-minute intervals over a month. Each series is of length 720 (24 hours of readings taken every 2 minutes). The three classes are CRT TV, LCD TV and Computer Monitor.

# OliveOil

Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. Each class of this data set is an extra virgin olive oil from alternative countries. Further information can be found in the original paper [1]. The data were first used in the time series classification literature in [2].

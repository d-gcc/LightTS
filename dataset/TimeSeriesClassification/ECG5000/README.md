# ECG5000

The original data set for *ECG5000* is a 20-hour long ECG downloaded from Physionet_ATM [1]. The database is BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database(chfdb) and the record is chf07. It was originally published by Goldberger et al. [2]. The data were pre-processed in two steps, first extracting each heartbeat and then making each heartbeat equal length using interpolation. These data were originally used by Chen et al. [3]. After that, 5000 heartbeats were randomly selected to make the current data set. Data were from a patient who has severe congestive heart failure. The class values were obtained by automated annotation.

# Lightning2

The Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events satellite (FORTE) detects transient electromagnetic events associated with lightning using a suite of optical and radio-frequency (RF) instruments. Sampling rate was 50 MHz over 800 microseconds. A Fourier transform is performed on the input data to produce a spectrogram. The spectrograms are then collapsed in frequency to produce a power density time series with 3181 samples in each time series. These are then smoothed to produce series of length 637. It is not known what the two classes are.

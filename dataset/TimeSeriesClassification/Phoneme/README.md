# Phoneme

This data set is a subsample of the data used in [1]. Each series is extracted from the segmented audio collected from Google Translate, oxforddictionaries.com and the Merrriam-Webster online dictionary. Each of these sources have different features. Audio files collected from Google translate, Oxford, and Merrriam-Webster dictionaries are recorded at 22050, 44100 and 11025 samples per second respectively. All of them have male and female speakers in different ratios. The Oxford dictionary includes British and American accent pronunciation for each word. After data collection, waveforms of the words are segmented to generate phonemes using the Forced Aligner tool from the Penn Phonetics Laboratory.

# PowerCons

The PowerCons data set contains the individual household electric power consumption in one year distributed in two season classes:  warm (class 1) and cold (class 2), depending on whether the power consumption is recorded during the warm seasons (from April to September) or the cold seasons (from October to March). The electric power consumption profiles differ markedly within classes. The sampling rate is every ten minutes over a period of one year.
